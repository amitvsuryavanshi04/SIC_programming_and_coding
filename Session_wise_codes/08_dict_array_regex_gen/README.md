## ðŸ“˜ Programs Included

### ðŸ“Š Dictionary Operations

- **71.** Check the order of characters in a string using `OrderedDict`  
- **72.** Sort a dictionary by keys and by values  

### ðŸ”¢ Array and List Processing

- **73.** Compute Q = âˆš[(2 Ã— C Ã— D)/H] using user input values  
- **74.** Generate a 2D array based on multiplication of indices  
- **75.** Sort comma-separated input words alphabetically  
- **76.** Remove duplicates from comma-separated words and sort them  
- **77.** Sort comma-separated words case-insensitively using `.casefold()`  

### ðŸ§ª Regex & Generator

- **78.** Count the number of letters and digits in a given sentence  
- **79.** Validate passwords using length, case, digit, and symbol checks with regex  
- **80.** Generate numbers divisible by 7 up to a user-specified limit using a generator
